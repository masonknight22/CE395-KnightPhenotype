# KnightPhenotype
First attempt at Data Analysis.
I created a csv via Excel that listed my relatives on my fathers side. I mapped out each of our hair color, eye color, and skin shades. I then visualized the data within Excel. I then attempted to repeat the same thing through Python with Pandas and Matplotlib.


Here is the Excel view.
